# WhiteBoxEdgeExp

Code for reproducing the ECML-PKDD 2025 submission "A True-to-the-model Benchmark for Edge-level Attributions of GNN Explainers".

The environment of the experiments can be replicated through the requirements.txt file. Additionally, the SubgraphX explainer can be used by installing GraphXAI library from https://github.com/mims-harvard/GraphXAI.

All the experiments can be replicated by running: 
```
python main.py
python main_realdata.py
python main_weight.py
```
All plots and figures can be replicated using the plot.ipynb and checking_explanation.ipynb notebooks.
